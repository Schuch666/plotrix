* This is mainly a release to set myself as the new maintainer.
* It also fixes one bug that was reported on Jim Lemon's Github site,
  and removes one line from an example that caused an error in the
  "check donttest" tests.
* I haven't run revdep checks; they would take hours here, and changes
are pretty minimal.
